# algorithms-and-data-structures-2-python
Python labs I did in the second semester of learning efficient algorithms and data structures
Lab 1 - takes all area codes in America and let's you perform certain functions on them
Lab 2 - basically linked list that replicates what pointers in C++ do
Lab 6 - Counts the smallest number of coins to make change for different values of coin. 
If you want to run it make sure to follow the beginning parameter of not adding the number one, and entering the coin values in order.
